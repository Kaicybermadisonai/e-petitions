Dear <%= @creator.name %>,

You’re not done yet!

<%= number_to_word(Site.threshold_for_moderation).titleize %> people need to sign your petition for us to check it.

Send your potential supporters the information at the bottom of this email.

Once you’ve gained <%= number_to_word(Site.threshold_for_moderation) %> signatures, we’ll check your petition to make sure it meets the petition standards. If it does, we’ll publish it. If it doesn’t, we’ll let you know why.

We currently have a very large number of petitions to check, so it may take a number of weeks to check your petition. Thank you for your patience.

Up to <%= Site.maximum_number_of_sponsors %> people can sign your petition while we are checking it. Please wait until it’s been checked and published before sharing it more widely.
